constexpr int NUM_GENERATIONS = 500;
constexpr int GENERATION_SIZE = 100;
constexpr double CROSSOVER_PROB = 0.7;
constexpr double MUTATION_PROB = 0.001;

i wanted to see how an even higher number of generations affected the results
i was noticing a fall-off as generations increased past like 50

and it seems i am correct!
