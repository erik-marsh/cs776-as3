Any proportion = [1..1.5]
Rooms must fit inside an outer rectangle
Float values are restricted to [0, 102.3]
    bitstring len = 10
The room is laid out on a xy grid with a stride of 0.1 in both the x and y directions
Rooms only require the following information
    length, width, xpos, ypos
    (xpos, ypos) is the bottom coordinates left of the room
Rooms must not overlap
    AABB method
Rooms must be adjacent
    no idea how to specify this yet ngl
if a constraint is not met, that translates to 0 fitness
Initialization of the chromosome is random EXCEPT that we specify 5.5 len and 8.5 width for the bathroom every time
    this saves us some search time, theoretically
a roomset is {Living, Kitchen, Bath, Hall, Bed1, Bed2, Bed3}
