same as last try but i upped the number of generations from 50 to 250 (2.5x the population size)
no real difference
its worth noting that i changed the fitness function from a 1/x form to a C-x form
and now we have sensible fitness values!


i went back and tried 50 gens again

min => [0, 0]
max => [~73, ~81]
